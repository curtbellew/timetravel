Visual Standards Review 
-----------------------
Group 1
Dashboard
/1. 1.4.3 contrast minimum
Page heading.  the H2
/2. 3.2.4 Consistent identification = More Info links.  We don't actually fix this - just debate it.  It is superceded by 2.4.4
These buttons all have different text why not make them all "More Info"?  Don says no no no
/3. 2.4.4 Link purpose
"More Info" link needs more text to identify what it's related to.
-- Assuming the same link text is OK then we can debate that.
-- wcag AAA requires them to be unique but AA doesn't.
-- "Y2K (More Details)"

Group 2
Details page
/4. 1.3.3 sensory characteristics - Fix is to Remove message "To check trip availability click the button on the bottom right."
Fix is to Remove message at top.  Change button text to "Check Availability"
/5. 1.4.1 Use of color
Cancel and Book buttons have no text.  Bottom left
Make sure that the color of the button has  contrast ratio with it's background that is legal too 3:1 .
/6. 1.4.4 resize text Detail page.  Constrain trip descriptions - use the longest description name at 200%
constrain description text so that it will not wrap - will cutoff text.
-- Add more text to the desriptions
